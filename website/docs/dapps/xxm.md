# xx Messenger

[xx Messenger](https://xxmessenger.io/) is a messaging app originally developed by the Elixxir team. The aim of the team was to use the app as a global test and build out the [xxDK](../category/xxdk)

xx Messgenger is no longer being actively developed but has functioning [Android](https://links.xx.network/playstore) and [iOS](https://links.xx.network/appstore) apps. It can be used "as is" but should not be considered "stable".

Source code for both platforms, [Android](https://github.com/xxfoundation/elixxir-xx-Messenger-Android) and [iOS](https://github.com/xxfoundation/elixxir-xx-messenger-iOS), are available for anyone who wishes to make use of it.
