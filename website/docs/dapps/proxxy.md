# Proxxy

Proxxy is a technology that leverages the xx Network's
[cMixx](../cmixx/cmixx.md) network to provide metadata protection
to users of web3.

With Proxxy, any wallet can integrate better privacy, in order to avoid
user's data being collected by RPC providers.

Currently, in order to use Proxxy, users have to install a desktop
application, which will act as a local proxy to supported blockchain
networks.

In principle, any wallet that supports adding custom networks will work
with the Proxxy App, but for now MetaMask is the main wallet being
targeted.

In the future, Proxxy technology will be made into an API that can be
integrated directly in any wallet. However, this will always be
dependent on developers of said wallets doing the integration,
potentially in partnerships with the xx Network.

You can use Proxxy now by downloading the Desktop App, navigating to the
Proxxy [webpage](https://proxxy.xx.network), and following the
connection flow.

## Why is Proxxy needed?

Anytime a user interacts with a blockchain using a website or mobile
wallet connecting to anything other than the RPC endpoint of a
personally operated full node, it is leaking data that can be gathered.

This data might not be collected by RPC providers, but it can be. This
lack of privacy has been known and acknowledged for a long time
(Coindesk
[article](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/11/08/the-little-known-ways-ethereum-reveals-user-location-data/))
and remains one to this day with RPC providers:

***"MetaMask must have an RPC provider to work, and an RPC provider must
collect your IP and wallet address to work"*** [^1]

When a user connects to a public RPC endpoint, of any blockchain, the
owner of that endpoint can see all the traffic coming and going.

Metadata such as IP address can be used to determine location, date &
time can be used to find routines, and often more, such as tracking data
from a browser that can be used to create social graphs, user profiles
and personal information, etc ([Understanding browser
tracking](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/internetsafety/understanding-browser-tracking/1/)).

The following image represents how user metadata is leaked to the RPC
provider when using MetaMask.

By collecting the metadata and transaction data, Infura can associate a
source address of any transaction with information that might help
identify the user, effectively breaking the pseudonymity provided by the
blockchain.

With Proxxy, users are safe to interact with a public RPC endpoint, and
their metadata and/or browser data does not end up in the possession of
the company operating the RPC infrastructure.

## How does Proxxy work?

Proxxy uses a pair of client / server applications that communicate over
the cMixx network.

The client receives RPC requests from the wallet application interacting
with a given blockchain and sends them over cMixx to the Relay server.

The Relay server then forwards the request to configured RPC endpoints
according to the blockchain network the user is interacting with.

The RPC endpoint replies to the request and the Relay server then
forwards it back to the client over x, which then responds back to
the wallet application.

The source code for Proxxy client / server applications can be found
[here](https://github.com/xx-labs/blockchain-cmix-relay).

The Proxxy App wraps the client side application, so that the user is
presented with a simple interface and experience, instead of requiring
the use of a command line application.

The source code for the Proxxy App and Website can be found
[here](https://github.com/xx-labs/proxxy).

The following image shows how user metadata is protected when using
MetaMask with the Proxxy App.


![](@site/static/img/MetaMask_with_Proxxy.png)


Infura can still collect metadata, but now this will always be
information about the Relay Server, so there is no way to associate
source addresses to user information, thus maintaining the pseudonymity
properties provided by the blockchain.

### How does the app contact a Relay Server?

The Proxxy App can contact any number of Relay Servers, and the only
information required is the Relay server contact data, which is
generated by the server when connecting to the cMixx network.

The xx Foundation maintains a
[file](https://nx38767.your-storageshare.de/s/8PTGRzoHtxNpHZy) with the
contact data of active Relay Servers.

It's important to note that even if the xx Foundation was malicious, and
changed the contact information of the Relay Servers, user's metadata is
STILL PROTECTED by cMixx. This can be seen in the image above, as the
Relay Server can only pick up messages from the cMixx network, which have
been stripped of all metadata.

In other words, malicious Relay Servers cannot gather user metadata over
the cMixx network. This is a clear contrast to some privacy protecting
technologies, which rely on a direct connection with a relay server.
When a wallet does not use cMixx and directly connects to a relay server,
a malicious relay server provider will be able to gather user metadata,
the same as an RPC provider.

## Metamask Recommendations

Before setting up Proxxy with MetaMask, it is recommended to disable
multiple settings that reduce the user's privacy.

In order to disable these settings, open your MetaMask wallet, go to
Settings -> Security & Privacy and disable the following:

-   Show balance and token price checker
-   Show incoming transactions
-   Autodetect tokens
-   Batch account balance requests
-   Participate in MetaMetrics

## Download and Install

**The Proxxy app is available for Windows, Linux and Mac machines.**
**Refer to the detailed instructions below for your operating
    system.**
    
###  Windows Instructions.
1.  Download the Proxxy file for Windows
[here](https://nx38767.your-storageshare.de/s/wYsHnZZKZqMZXxW/download?path=%2F&files=Proxxy-win-x64.exe).
2.  In the file browser, navigate to the folder where the
application was downloaded to and double-click the file.

3.  You may get a notice saying "Windows protected your PC"
preventing you from running the program. This is common with
newer applications that have not yet been registered with
Windows OS. To get past the SmartScreen filter, click on the
"*More info"* link.

5.  A warning will appear saying that the developer cannot be
verified. Click the *OK b*utton. This warning might look
different on older macOS versions, which could have a
*Cancel* button. If so, press that button instead.

6.  Next, click on the Apple icon in the top left corner of your
screen in the menu bar. In the drop-down menu, select System
*Preferences…*.
![](@site/static/img/Open_System_Preferences_from_Apple_Menu.png)If
your machine is running macOS Ventura (version 13 and up),
you should select "System Settings..."
instead.![](@site/static/img/System_settings.png)
7.  The System Preferences window will show up. Click on
*Security & Privacy*.
![](@site/static/img/Security_&_Privacy_in_System_Preferences.png)If
your machine is running macOS Ventura (version 13 and up),
the menu is now called "Privacy &
Security"![](@site/static/img/Macos_PrivacyAndSecurity.png)
8.  Scroll down on the settings until you find a prompt where it
says *"Proxxy" was blocked…*, click the *Open Anyway*
button.

11. When launching the app for the first time after unblocking
it in the Security settings in some machines, it will stay
black and not load. If this happens, close the app and open
it again. It should now work.
### Linux instructions.
1.  Download the file, according to your CPU architecture:
