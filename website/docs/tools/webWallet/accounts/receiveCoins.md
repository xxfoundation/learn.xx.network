# Receive Coins

You can receive coins from someone by sending your wallet address to
that person.

First, you may want to [derive a new wallet](./addAccount.md#deriving-a-wallet).

1.  In the navigation menu, go to *Accounts* and in the drop-down menu,
    click on *Accounts*. Or navigate to
    https://wallet.xx.network/#/accounts.

    of the account name to copy the wallet address.
