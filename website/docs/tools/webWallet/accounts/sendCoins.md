    a.  Select one of your wallets to send the coins from. Ensure that
        it has enough coins to send the amount desired and that it does
        not go below the existential deposit (e).
    
    b.  Select the wallet to send coins to.
    
    c.  Select the number of coins to send. Use the drop-down on the
        right to select the denomination.
    
    d.  The number of coins in your wallet cannot drop below the
        existential deposit. Having less coins results in your account
        being inactive.

        details
