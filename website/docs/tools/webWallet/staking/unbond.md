# Unbonding xx Coins
Unbonding is a 28 day, multi-step process. Bonded coins must first be "Unbonded" and then "Redeemed" before they are "Transferable".

## Unbond Funds
To the right of the stash, expand the 3 dot menu and click "Unbond funds".

When prompted to sign the transaction it will ask for the controller account password. Input the password and click the "Sign and Submit" button.

Unbonding takes 28 days. The time remaining until the coins are redeemable can be viewed by visiting [Accounts](https://wallet.xx.network/#/accounts). Click the carrot button to expand the account details and hover the mouse pointer over the information icon to the right of "unbonding".

## Redeem Funds
Once 28 days has passed and unbonding is complete, the coins will be marked "redeemable" as indicated by a small "lock icon".


Redeeming the coins can be done via https://wallet.xx.network/#/accounts

Or if the coins were "Staked" also via https://wallet.xx.network/#/staking/actions

Pressing the small "lock icon" will open a familiar "authorize transaction" dialog. When prompted to sign the transaction it will ask for the account password. Input the password and click the "Sign and Submit" button.

## Transferable Funds
The coins are now "unbonded" and "transferable". You can now [Send Coins](http://localhost:3000/tools/webWallet/accounts/sendCoins).
