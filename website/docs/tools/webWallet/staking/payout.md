# Payouts

## Claim Rewards

You may receive an xx coin payout at the end of every era in which you
are an active nominator on an active validator. Your payouts do not go
into your wallet automatically; they must be manually claimed by you or
one of the other stakers on that payoutâ€™s node. When one of the stakers
on a node claims the payout for an era, it is automatically claimed for
all other stakers on the node. There is a deadline by which each payout
must be claimed before it is lost.

To see any available payouts, go to the *Payouts* tab on the *Staking*
page or navigate to the [*Payouts*
page](https://wallet.xx.network/#/staking/payout). From here, you can
see the aggregate payouts available per bonded stash, as well as a list
of all the individual payouts available to claim. You may claim each of
these one-by-one by clicking on the *Payout* button on the right, or you
can claim all of your payouts with the *Payout all* button at the top
right. If you have been actively nominating for at least a day and you
do not see any payouts, it is likely another staker already claimed the
payout for you and the coins are already in your stash wallet. All
payouts are automatically rebonded into the stash account that earned
them.
