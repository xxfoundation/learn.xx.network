# Bonding xx Coins

How many xx coins you bond is up to you. The action of bonding coins is sometimes referred to as locking but should not be confused for staking. It is possible to bond coins without staking them. This can be done by first creating a stash without the intention to nominate or validate.

After [Adding Accounts to the Web Wallet](../accounts/addAccount.md) visit [Account Actions](https://wallet.xx.network/#/staking/actions)

When prompted to sign the transaction it will ask for the stash account password. Input the password and click the "Sign and Submit" button.

The newly added stash can be viewed in the "All stashes" and "Inactive" tabs.
