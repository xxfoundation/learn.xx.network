# iOS SDK

## Installation
The Elixxir SDK requires the use of the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/)â€”a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. To use the SDK, add it to dependencies in your `Package.swift` file.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://git.xx.network/elixxir/elixxir-dapps-sdk-swift")
]
```

## Initialization
The instructions below describe how to initialize the client and connect to the network.

1. First, you will need to create a secure area to store client data. You can do this by creating a `PasswordStorage` for saving and loading your client storage. For example purposes we will use UserDefaults, but really encourage you to not use it and use `Keychain`  instead. 

    ```swift
    let demoPasswordStorage = PasswordStorage(
    save: { password in
        UserDefaults.standard.set(password, forKey: "SDKPassword")
    },
    load: {
        UserDefaults.standard.value(forKey: "SDKPassword") as! Data
    })
    ```

2. Next, create a client storage to manage client data stored on disk.

    ```swift
    let clientStorage = ClientStorage.live(passwordStorage: demoPasswordStorage)
    ```

3. If a client storage already exists, load it instead of creating a new one.

    ```swift
    let client = Client

    /*
    //loadClient is a blocking call, do it on the background thread
    //createClient is a blocking call, do it on the background thread
    */

    if clientStorage.hasStoredClient() {
    client = try? clientStorage.loadClient()
    } else {
    client = try? clientStorage.createClient()
    }
    ```

4. Next, create an identity. You will need to create a connection later.

    ```swift
    /*
    //Blocking call, do it on the background thread
    */
    let myIdentity = try client.makeIdentity()
    ```

5. Start the network follower.

    ```swift
    let networkFollower = client.networkFollower

    /*
    //Blocking call, do it on the background thread
    //Time is in millisecond
    */
    try networkFollower.start(timeoutMS: 30_000) 
    ```

6. Finally, wait for the network to be connected.       

    ```swift
    /*
    //Blocking call, do it on the background thread
    //Time is in millisecond
    */
    let isConnected = client.waitForNetwork(30_000)  
    guard isConnected else { /* try again */ }
    ```

## Send Rest-like message
The instructions below describe how to use the restlike API to send requests and receive messages like a rest API.

1. First, create an E2E client.

    ```swift
    /*
    //Blocking call, do it on the background thread.
    */
    let clientE2E = try ClientE2ELogin.live(with: client)
    ```

2. Next, to initiate a connection with the remote, use an unauthenticated connection. (To get remote identity, please refer to [this](https://git.xx.network/elixxir/client/-/blob/release/restlike/README.md).)

    ```swift
    /*
    //Blocking call, do it on the background thread
    // You need your remote identity.
    */
    let connection = try client.connect(withAuthentication: false, recipientContact: REMOTE_IDENTITY, e2eId: clientE2E.getId())
    ```

3. Next, create a `RequestSender`.

    ```swift
    let restLikeRequestSender = RestlikeRequestSender.live(authenticated: false)
    ```

4. Create your request that you will send.

    ```swift
    /*
    //All fields are customizable to meet your remote configuration
    //Content accepts any json encoded object, this is where you include your request body
    //Method number is used to refer to get, post, put, etc.
    */
    let request = RestlikeMessage(
    version: Int,
    headers: YOUR_HEADERS,
    content: YOUR_JSON_ENCODED_MODEL,
    method: Int,
    Uri: String,
    error: String)
    ```

5. Send your request and wait for a response.

    ```swift
    /*
    //Blocking call, do it on the background thread
    //Response is RestLikeMessage object
    */

    let response = try? restLikeRequestSender.send(
    client.getId(),
    connection!.getId(),
    request)

    /* 
    //Jumping to the main thread to update any UI with the response
    */
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
    let message = response 
    //Use the response message here to update UI
    }
    ```

## Send E2E message

1. First, create an E2E client.

    ```swift
    /*
    //Blocking call, do it on the background thread.
    */
    let clientE2E = try ClientE2ELogin.live(with: client)
    ```

2. Next, to initiate a connection with the remote, use an unauthenticated connection. (To get remote identity, please refer to [this](https://git.xx.network/elixxir/client/-/blob/release/restlike/README.md).)

    ```swift
    /*
    // Blocking call, do it on the background thread
    // You need your remote identity.
    */
    let connection = try client.connect(
    withAuthentication: false,
    recipientContact: REMOTE_IDENTITY,
    e2eId: clientE2E.getId())
    ```

2. Setup your messages listener.

    ```swift
    /*
    //Blocking call, do it on the background thread
    //messageType value must be same as the value you will use to send a message
    */
    connection.listen(messageType: Int) { message in
    /* 
    //Jumping to the main thread to update any UI with the message
    */
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        let msg = message
        //Use the received message here to update UI
    }
    }
    ```

3. Send the message and wait to get the send report, which contains the delivery status.

    ```swift
    /*
    //Blocking call, do it on the background thread
    //messageType value must be same as the value you used to setup your messages listener
    */
    let sendReport = try connection?.send(
    messageType: Int,
    payload: YOUR_JSON_ENCODED_MODEL)
    ```

4. Wait for the message to be delivered and update the UI if needed.

    ```swift
    /*
    //Blocking call, do it on the background thread
    //Time is in millisecond
    */

    client.waitForDelivery(report: sendReport, timeoutMS: 30_000) { result in
    /* 
    //Jumping to the main thread to update any UI
    */
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        switch result {
        case .delivered(let roundResults):
        // You can stop loading indicator here for example
        case .notDelivered:
        //Show error popup here for example
        }
    }
    }
    ```
