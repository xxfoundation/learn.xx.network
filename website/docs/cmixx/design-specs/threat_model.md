## Introduction

As of this writing the Elixxir mixnet only has one application known
as the xx messenger, an end to end encrypted chat client which does
one on one and group chat.  However the Elixxir mixnet is designed for
general purpose usage. It can support a wide variety of
applications. We may end up designing several mixnet protocols to
support these various applications. Each of these protocols will have
different security and privacy properties. The purpose of this
document is to describe the threat model for the entire mix network
and it's basic protocol which is to be augmented by protocol
composition for each specific mixnet protocol.

Therefore to read the full threat model of a given application on the
Elixxir mix network, you must read this section first, it provides the
base mixnet threat model. And then you read the security and anonymity
consideration sections of the [end to end protocol design](end_to_end.md).


## Network Composition

As mentioned in the [architectural overview
document](architecture.md), the PKI system is the root of all
authority in the mix network. The anonymity privacy and security
properties of the mixnet very much depend on the security of the PKI.
If the PKi is compromised, the adversary can swap out the old mix
cascades for his own mix cascades where the adversary knows all the
mix private keys and can therefore link senders and receivers.

As mentioned in the xx network [wire protocol design](wire.md), our TLS link
layer is used to encrypt all communications between each component of
the network.

The cMix encryption is composed on the clients and terminates on the
last mix node. The last mix node in a given route forwards the
messages to the destination service on the gateway system. These
messages are not protected with the cMix encryption. For some
applications this is perfectly acceptable. However for encrypted chat
the clients must use end to end encryption to protect the
confidentiality of the messages.

The last mix in the cascade and the terminating gateway get to see the
message plaintext. Therefore the end to end encryption must not
contain any bitwise distinguishable patterns corresponding to client
identity. Likewise messages must be padded to a fixed length.

## Anonymity Set

A this time the Elixxir mix network does not try to hide which mix
cascade a given client is using for a given mix round. Clients
directly connect to gateways nodes which relay messages to the mix
cascade. These gateways are only connected to one mix cascade so it's
trivial for the global passive adversary determine the mix cascade
being used.

If future design changes allowed the gateways to hide which mix
cascade a given client is using then this would effectively let
Elixxir's anonymity set size scale up linearly with the number of
cascades. Likewise we can measure in terms of Shannon entropy instead
of anonymity set size, they are equivalent in terms of the uncertainty
the adversary would have linking input messages with output messages.
Currently however the anonymity set size is the number of
message slots for a mix round no matter how many cascades there are.

## Privacy Notions

Just as cryptographers use hierarchical graphs of security notions to
reason about cryptographic primitives, so too must we use privacy
notions to reason about anonymous communication network privacy
properties. ACN privacy notions describe precisely what kind of
metadata cannot be prevented from leaking. Furthermore these privacy
notions can be used as a basis of comparison when looking at various
anonymous communication protocols.

For more information about ACN privacy notions see "On Privacy Notions
in Anonymous Communication" by Christiane Kuhn, Martin Beck, Stefan
Schiffner, Eduard Jorswieck, Thorsten Strufe
https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05638

After rereading this paper it is my best guess that the privacy notions
for the Elixxir mixnet with the xx messenger chat client is:

 - Sender Unobservability
 - Receiver Unobservability
 - Sender Receiver Unlinkability
 - Sender Message Unlinkability
 - Receiver Message Unlinkability

## Decoy Traffic

Currently the xx messenger does make use of any decoy traffic and that
is why it does provide the two "Unobservability" notions for both
senders and receivers. In other words, xx messenger clients both send
and receive decoy and legitimate messages. Therefore a passive
network observer or a curious network operator cannot ever know with
absolute certainty when a xx messenger client sends or receives a
legitimate message.

The decoy traffic also enhances the mixnet's resistance to intersection attacks
which are also known as long term statistical disclosure attacks.
See the section below ``Long term statistical disclosure attacks``.

## Mixnet Attacks and Defenses

All mixnets have attacks that are in each of these categories. In this
section we summarize how the attack works and enumerate our defenses
or partial defenses for these attacks. Here we attempt to
exhaustively list ALL attacks and in doing so we organize them by
category. If there are any attacks for which we have no mitigation
then we shall mention this below.

### Compulsion attacks

**Attack Description**

In the context of attacking mixnets, the compulsion attacks is when
the adversary obtains control of the mix node or mix node private key
material in order to determine the linkages between input and output
messages for that mix node. This attack must be repeated in sequence for
each mix node in the cascade in order to link the cascade inputs with
the cascade outputs.

**Attack Defences**

Firstly, let it be known that Elixxir protects against the compulsion
attack primarily with frequent mix node cmix private key
rotations. The PKI is continually generating more mix cascades and
publishing them to the network. Adversaries cannot predict what a
future cascade will be. If some mix keys are captured by the adversary
they will only be useful for a very limited period of time, a few
seconds.

In some circumstances the compulsion attack may involve breaking some
cryptographic protocols. Therefore the addition of the cryptographic
wire protocol (Elixxir uses TLS) should make such cryptographic compulsion
attacks more difficult by providing the adversary with another cryptographic
protocol to break.

### Epistemic attacks

**Attack Description**

Epistemic attacks are attacks conducted by an adversary who uses
their knowledge of the target to their advantage. In the classical
ACN literature examples of these attacks are described where the
network PKI information about all the network nodes is not uniformly
distributed among the clients. The Adversary can identify clients
based on their usage of the network.

**Current Status**

In our case simply by watching the mixnet traffic, one can learn the
mix cascade that a given target client is using. This isn't a devastating
attack, however it does limit the mix entropy to the number of message
slots in a mixing batch.

Clients however do not send messages directly to their cascade. They
send the message to a gateway node which relays the message to the
cascade's gateway; however gateways only make use of one cascade and
so it's trivial for a global passive adversary to determine which
cascade a given client is using. Therefore the Elixxir mixnet
anonymity set size is fixed as the number of message slots per mixing
batch.

**Future Mitigation**

An advantageous design would be able to increase the mix entropy
linearly with the number of cascades in the network as would be the
case if the gateway nodes formed another two layers of continuous time
mix nodes; in order to hide which cascade a given client message is
destined to. This would be a good approach if we can overcome some of
the associated engineering challenges.

### N-1 attacks

**Attack Description**

An N-1 attack is a category of mixnet specific attacks where the
adversary controls all but one message which is being mixed.
In the context of a batch mix like cMix we can say that the
adversary performing an n-1 attack is able to determine which output slot
the target message is destined to.

Elixxir uses the cMix mixing strategy which has a fixed number of message
slots. However a timing schedule is imposed where gateways fill
message slots with dummy messages if not enough messages were received
before the mixing round deadline. An N-1 attack that would work
against the Elixxir mixnet would be as follows:

   The adversary awaits the new mixing round and then fills all but
   one message slot with his own messages. The final message slot is
   then reserved for the target client. The adversary may drop or
   delay messages if a non-target client submits a message. It would
   be obvious to the adversary which output message was sent by the
   target client.

In the context of Elixxir we are using fixed predetermined cascades of
mixes therefore performing such an attack on the entry mix node gets
us the results when all the messages exit the cascade.

Elixxir also has a special variation of the above N-1 attack where
the adversary compromises the gateway node that the target client is using.
The adversary simply causes the gateway to insert dummy messages in all
message slots except that of the target message.

**What is the Elixxir defense to this attack?**

Gateway must accept messages for all cascades.

Also Benjamin Wenger describes a future cMix variation:

Instead of having just the first node collect messages to input into
the cascade, you have every node in the team collect 1/teamsize of the
batch size.

You can have them all send these to the first node in
order to be included in the cascade, but this would result in a
latency increase for the time of that transmission (a back of the
napkin estimate put this at 100~500ms of extra latency).  This extra
latency can be eliminated by reconstructing the first pass of cmix
(the unpermuted phase, known in the code as realtime decrypt) to
operate as teamsize parallel cascades of with 1/teamsize slots. these
would be constructed to start at Team Member and end at the first
member of the team so it can then start the second permuted cascade as
normal.

Depending on the properties of the parallel cascade, this
cascade may be faster than the current implementation because it is
more parallelized.  Due to how the the final unwrapping phase (post
permutation) is dependent on keys in both cascade phases, and how each
node in the team add further keying material in the permutation phase,
the ignoring of sub-cascades from the first pass would result in many
garbled payloads, which as a result of the tagging attack defenses
would be indistinguishable from any valid payloads they did include in
their attempted n-1 attack, nullifying the attack under the
assumptions of the tagging attack defenses, primarily the
effectiveness of the overly dense address space.


### statistical disclosure attacks

#### Short term timing correlation attack

**Attack Description**

Short term timing correlation attacks use message timing to link
messaging flowing into the ACN from clients with messages flowing out
of the ACN to clients.

**Attack Defences**

These attacks don't apply to mixnets. Short term attacks should be
prevented by the mixing strategy which adds latency and bitwise
unlinkability creating uncertainty for the global passive adversary
who is trying to link input and output messages for each mix in the
route.

#### Long term statistical disclosure attacks

**Attack Description**

These attacks are also sometimes referred to as set intersection
attacks. Generally speaking there are two varieties of such attacks:

1. determine set recipients for target sender
2. determine set of senders for target receiver

This attack assumes a global passive adversary who watches
the mix network. Everytime the target sender sends a messages,
the adversary records a set of recipients that received
a message from the sender's mix cascade. For each message
the target sends, the set of recipients will be different.
Over time the adversary records many such recipient sets and
can assume that the intersections of such sets yields the set
of recipients.

**Attack Defenses**

Elixxir reduces the information leakage of intersection attacks
by means of message ID collisions. Clients make use of
deterministic message IDs as a lookup key for messages received
over the mixnet. This results in many clients retreiving their
messages via the same message ID. Thus the set intersections
in the above attack would yield many more clients than
the desired recipients for the target sender.

**Future Work**

Make use of some probability model to assist us in judiciously tuning
the few mixnet parameters that mitigate this attack:

1. Tune the message ID collision space
2. Tune the mixing batch size (number of message slots)
3. Number of decoy messages to send and how frequent to send them

**Additional Future Work**

This attack is also mitigated by hiding which mix cascade a given
client is using. We will explore how to do this in another attack which
we should reference here so we know that this is actually the solution
to multiple attacks.

### High-level protocol traffic correlation attacks

It is possible that layering protocols on top of mixnet protocols
results in unexpected emergent behavior that cancels out the privacy
notions of the mixnet by leaking additional statistical
information. The Elixxir development team currently believes their
existing mixnet protocols are simple enough that there is no emergent
behavior which would cause additional privacy leaks.

Perhaps in the future formal methods could help us gain more confidence
there is no unexpected emergent protocol behavior.


### cMix attacks mentioned in published academic papers

#### Tagging attacks

**Tagging Attack Description**

In the classical mixnet literature tagging attacks usually refer to attacks
where the adversary can discovery at least a 1-bit flip for confirmation.
Whereas these bit flipping related confirmation attacks do not apply to
non-cryptographically-malleable mixnet message formats, such as cMix.

For cMix and thus the Elixxir mixnet, there is a group homomorphic tagging
attack which is summarized as follows:

The first mix node in the cascade "adds it's tag" to the target message
by means of modulo-multiplication. Later the last mix node in the cascade
can confirm the presence of the tag by multiplying the tag inverse and checking
that the output message format is well formed.

**Attack Defence**

This attack doesn't apply to Elixxir because well formed output messages are
indistinguishable from pseudo random noise. Therefore the adversary cannot
confirm the presense of the tag. Likewise the tagging attack described in
"Attacks on cMix - Some Small Overlooked Details" is also prevented by valid
messages being indistinguishable from invalid messages.

#### Insider Attack

"Attacks on cMix - Some Small Overlooked Details" mentions
the Insider Atack which does not apply to the Elixxir mixnet:

**TODO: Write an explanation of why the Insider Attack doesn't work.**
