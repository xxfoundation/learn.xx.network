## Abstract

This document describes the xx network cMix design variations and
implementation parameterizations; that is, our mixing strategy
which is at the core design of our anonymous communication network.

## Introduction

**cMix** is a verified batch mixing strategy which uses the cryptographic and
partial homomorphic properties of the [ElGamal encryption protocol](https://people.csail.mit.edu/alinush/6.857-spring-2015/papers/elgamal.pdf),
which is described at length in the [published cMix paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/008.pdf).
However this document will very likely be a much more approachable description
of the core designs of the cMix mixing strategy.

One of the main motivations behind the cMix design is the
computational efficiency of the real time mixing phase of the protocol
which does not perform any public key operations. The real time phase
is essentially a series of modular multiplications within a prime
order cyclic group. This is made possible by the precomputation phase.

## Ciphersuite

For our cMix implementation we are using the RFC 3526 specified 4096
bit Mod P cyclic group for our ElGamal/cMix encryption and homomorphic
operations:

```
This prime is: 2^4096 - 2^4032 - 1 + 2^64 * { [2^3966 pi] + 240904 }

   Its hexadecimal value is:

## Message Structure

Due to the nature of how ElGamal encryption works, the cMix payload in the paper
is the same size as the encryption keys. In the case of the xx network
we use two payloads (defined below as `payloadA` and `payloadB`), each are 4096 bits
in size as our keys are 4096 bits.

```
                            Message Structure (not to scale)
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                               Message                                              |
|                                          2*primeSize bits                                          |

|                    2*primeSize - recipientID bits                      |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

* size: size in bits of the data which is stored
* Contents1 size = primeSize - grpBitASize - KeyFPLen - sizeSize - 1
* Contents2 size = primeSize - grpBitBSize - MacLen - RecipientIDLen - timestampSize
* the size of the data in the two contents fields is stored within the "size" field

/////Adherence to the group/////////////////////////////////////////////////////
The first bits of keyFingerprint and MAC are enforced to be 0, thus ensuring
PayloadA and PayloadB are within the group
```

Contents1 and Contents2 are used to transmit the mix network client's
payload whereas the other sections of the message have various other
uses. Our [source code](https://git.xx.network/elixxir/primitives/-/blob/release/format/message.go)
represents this with a Message type in Go:

```
// Message structure stores all the data serially. Subsequent fields point to
// subsections of the serialised data.
type Message struct {
	data []byte

	// Note: These are mapped to locations in the data object
	payloadA []byte
	payloadB []byte

	keyFP        []byte
	version      []byte
	contents1    []byte
	mac          []byte
	contents2    []byte
	ephemeralRID []byte // Ephemeral reception ID
	sih          []byte // Service Identification Hash

	rawContents []byte
}
```

One byte is used to indicate the message format version because it's
conceivable we could upgrade the message format in the future. The
grpBitA and grpBitB bits are carefully set to avoid 0 vs 1 biasing
which would allow for a probabalistic tagging attack:

```
SetGroupBits takes a message and a cyclic group and randomly sets
the highest order bit in its 2 sub payloads, defaulting to 0 if 1
would put the sub-payload outside of the cyclic group.

WARNING: the behavior above results in 0 vs 1 biasing. in general, groups
used have many (100+) leading 1s, which as a result would cause
a bias of ~ 1:(1-2^-numLeadingBits). with a high number of leading bits,
this is a non issue, but if a prime is chosen with few or no leading bits,
this will cease to solve the tagging attack it is meant to fix

Tagging attack: if the dumb solution of leaving the first bits as 0 is
chosen, it is possible for an attacker to 75% of the time (when one or
both leading bits flip to 1) identity a message they made multiplied
garbage into for a tagging attack. This fix makes the leading its
random in order to thwart that attack
```

## Protocol Phases

### Pseudo Code Cryptographic Function Glossary

The following sections are populated with pseudo code examples which
are used to explain sections of our cryptographic protocols. It is
hoped that this glossary will help you understand the pseudo code.

* |: byte concatenation

* H(x): H is a cryptographic hash function.

* HMAC(key, data): HMAC uses the given key to compute an HMAC over the given data.

* DH(my_private_key, partner_public_key):  
  Diffiehellman function used to calculate a shared secret.

* GenerateDHKeypair(): returns a DH keypair

* E(key, payload): Stream-cipher encrypt payload.

* D(key, payload): Stream-cipher decrypt payload.

* Sign(private_key, payload): Returns a cryptographic signature.

* Verify(public_key, data, signature): Returns a boolean which will be
  true if the `signature` is a signature of `data` and is valid for the
  given public key.


## Requisite Mathematical Considerations

You should be familiar with how the diffiehellman shared secret computation
works. If not we recommend reading the [Diffieâ€“Hellmen wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange).

Remember the transformations of exponents:

```
g^a * g^b = g^(a + b)
```

And also remember that just like addition and multiplication,
exponentiation is also commutative:

```
g^a^b = g^b^a = g^(a*b)
```

And likewise we must remember multiplying the inverse of a term
is equivalent to division by that term:

```
x^-1 = 1/x

g^b = g^(a*b) * g^a^-1

g^b = g^(a*b) / g^a
```

### Requisite ElGamal Encryption Considerations

The cMix paper defines it's ElGamal encryption function like this:

```
func elgamal_encrypt(key, payload []byte) ([]byte, []byte) {
	x = randKeyGen()
	return g^x, payload * key^x
}
```

However we define it like this in our implementation:

```
func elgamal_encrypt(key, payload []byte) ([]byte, []byte) {
	x = randKeyGen()
	return payload * g^x % p, key^x % p

}
```

That is, in either case the `elgamal_encrypt` function returns a
2-tuple, however in our implementation the first element of this
2-tuple contains the message ciphertext and the later element contains
the encrypted key.

In the above notation the `p` is meant to be our prime order cyclic
group as defined above in the [Ciphersuite](#Ciphersuite) section;
from now on the modulo will be implied and not explicitly written in
each expression and equation. In this ElGamal encryption example the
we generate a new key pair:

```
private_key = genKey()
public_key = g^private_key
```

In this next pseudo code sample we take `x` to be the randomly generated
key within the above `elgamal_encryption` function definition:

```
elgamal_encrypt(public_key, message)
// which is equivalent to either of these 2-tuples:
= (message * g^x, public_key^x)
= (message * g^x, g^private_key^x)
```
Our strip function definition looks like this:

```
func strip(key, ciphertext []byte) []byte {
	return (key^-1) * ciphertext
}
```
Which works like this:

```
private_key = genKey()
public_key = g^private_key

// computes: (sent_message * g^x, public_key^x)
ciphertext, encrypted_key = elgamal_encrypt(public_key, sent_message)

message = strip(encrypted_key * private_key^-1, ciphertext)

// which computes the message reveal:
strip(g^x, ciphertext)
// which is equivalent to:
strip(g^x, message * g^x)
// which could also be written like this:
(message * g^x) * g^x^-1
```

### Preparation Phase

Before sending a cMix message, the client needs to participate in a
preparatory protocol phase by sending key requests and processing
responses. This protocol interaction between the client and the
Gateway is done so using the [xx network's wire protocol](wire.md), also known as
gRPC/TLS/IP.

Each mix node is paired with one Gateway. The client is directly
connected to an arbitrary Gateway. All gateways are capable of
proxying the key requests to the correct Gateway. This Gateway in turn
proxies the key request to the destination mix node. The mix node's
reply takes the reverse of this route back to the client. This is a
strict request/response protocol with essentially only two message
types as we shall soon see.

![Client key request response protocol diagram](@site/static/img/client_proxy_gw_node_request_key.png)

The client composes a `ClientKeyRequest` and then encapsulates it within
a `SignedClientKeyRequest` along with a signature. Within the
`ClientKeyRequest` itself there is a `SignedRegistrationConfirmation`
which also must be verified by the recipient. Here are the protobuf
definitions for `ClientKeyRequest` and `SignedClientKeyRequest`:

```
message ClientKeyRequest {
    // Salt used to generate the Client ID
    bytes Salt = 1;
    // NOTE: The following entry becomes a pointer to the blockchain that denotes
    // where to find the users public key. The node can then read the blockchain
    // and verify that the registration was done properly there.
    SignedRegistrationConfirmation ClientTransmissionConfirmation = 2;
    // the timestamp of this request,
    int64 RequestTimestamp = 3;
    // timestamp of registration, tied to ClientRegistrationConfirmation
    int64 RegistrationTimestamp = 4;
    // The public key of the client for the purposes of creating the diffie helman sesskey
    bytes ClientDHPubKey = 5;
}

message SignedClientKeyRequest {
    // Wire serialized format of the ClientKeyRequest Object (above)
    bytes ClientKeyRequest = 1;
    // RSA signature signed by the client
    messages.RSASignature ClientKeyRequestSignature = 2;
    // Target Gateway/Node - used to proxy through an alternate gateway
    bytes Target = 3;
}
```

That `ClientKeyRequestSignature` is in fact not merely a signature of
the serialized `ClientKeyRequest` because the signing algorithm is RSA
therefore the output will be the same size as the input which in this
case is the hash of the serialized `ClientKeyRequest`. The client's DH
public key is cryptographically linked with this signature since it's
encapsulating message is serialized, hashed and then signed. This is
common practice when using RSA signatures.

Here's where the signature is created:

https://git.xx.network/elixxir/client/-/blob/release/network/node/register.go#L225


The response message is of type `SignedKeyResponse` which encapsulates
ClientKeyResponse:

```
message ClientKeyResponse {
    bytes EncryptedClientKey = 1;
    bytes EncryptedClientKeyHMAC = 2;
    bytes NodeDHPubKey = 3;
    bytes KeyID = 4; // Currently unused and empty.
    uint64 ValidUntil = 5; // Timestamp of when the key expires
}

message SignedKeyResponse {
    bytes KeyResponse = 1;
    messages.RSASignature KeyResponseSignedByGateway = 2;
    bytes ClientGatewayKey = 3; // Stripped off by node gateway
    string Error = 4;
}
```

However this message is proxied through the client's Gateway which
puts the `ClientGatewayKey` into a database and then removes it from the
message. Therefore the client only receives the `KeyResponse` and the
signature. As the field name implies, `KeyResponseSignedByGateway`
contains a signature computed by the Gateway.

Here we use pseudo code to show the cryptographic operations done by
the mix node after verifying that the sender is the authenticated
Gateway for this mix node:

```
func node_handle_key_request(request *SignedKeyRequest) (*SignedKeyResponse, error) {
	if !Verify(registrationPubKey,
	           H(timestamp | request.ClientKeyRequest.ClientTransmissionConfirmation.RSAPubKey),
			            request.ClientKeyRequest.ClientTransmissionConfirmation.RegistrarSignature) {
		return nil, SignatureVerificationFailure	
	}

	key = request.ClientKeyRequest.ClientTransmissionConfirmation.RSAPubKey
	data = H(request.ClientKeyRequest)
	signature = request.ClientKeyRequestSignature
	
	if !Verify(key, data, signature) {
		return nil, SignatureVerificationFailure	
	}

	encryption_key = DH(request.ClientKeyRequest.ClientDHPubKey, node_dh_priv_key)

	client_key = H(node_secret | client_ID)
	ciphertext = E(encryption_key, client_key)
	client_gateway_key = H(client_key)

	dh_pub_key, dh_priv_key = GenerateDHKeypair()
	session_key = DH(request.ClientKeyRequest.ClientDHPubKey, dh_priv_key)

	encrypted_key_hmac = HMAC(session_key, encrypted_key)

	return &SignedKeyResponse{
	        ClientGatewayKey: client_gateway_key,
			ClientKeyResponse: ClientKeyResponse{
					EncryptedClientKey:     encrypted_key,
					EncryptedClientKeyHMAC: encrypted_key_hmac,
					NodeDHPubKey:           dh_pub_key,
		},
	}, nil
}
```

The `SignedKeyResponse` is then proxied through the Gateway who signs
the message and removes the `ClientGatewayKey`, roughly in pseudo code
like this:

```
func gateway_proxy_response(response *SignedKeyResponse) *SignedKeyResponse {
	insert_into_database(response.ClientGatewayKey)
	return &SignedKeyResponse{
		KeyResponseSignedByGateway: Sign(gateway_private_key, H(response.ClientKeyResponse)),
		ClientKeyResponse: response.ClientKeyResponse,
	}
}
```

The client checks the response signature and then derives the
`encryption_key` via a Diffiehellman computation and then decrypts the
key:

```
func client_handle_response(response *SignedKeyResponse) {
	key = gateway_pub_key
	data = response.ClientKeyResponse
	signature = response.KeyResponseSignedByGateway
	
	if !Verify(key, data, signature) {
		return SignatureVerificationFailure
	}
	encryption_key = DH(client_dh_priv_key, response.ClientKeyResponse.NodeDHPubKey)
	key = D(encryption_key, response.ClientKeyResponse.EncryptedClientKey)

	do_stuff_with_key(key)
}
```

## Message Encryption

For the given mix cascade which the client has selected to transport
their message, the client must combine the set of mix keys by
multiplying them together. The resulting key is then used to encrypt
the cMix message payload.

cMix message encryption is simply modular multiplication as described
in the ElGamal paper. The cMix paper defines it's ElGamal encryption
function like this:

```
func elgamal_encrypt(key, payload []byte) ([]byte, []byte) {
	x = randKeyGen()
	return g^x % p, payload * key^x % p
}
```

However we define it like this in our implementation:

```
func elgamal_encrypt(key, payload []byte) ([]byte, []byte) {
	x = randKeyGen()
	return payload * g^x % p, key^x % p

}
```

That is, in either case the `elgamal_encrypt` function returns a
2-tuple, however in our implementation the first element of this
2-tuple contains the message ciphertext and the later element contains
the encrypted key.

In the above notation the `p` is meant to be our prime order cyclic
group from RFC 3526; from now on the modulo will be implied and not explicitly
written in each expression and equation.

As previously mentioned, the cMix message has two payloads. Therefore the
function to encrypt our client cMix payloads looks like this:

```
func clientEncrypt(msg Message, salt []byte, roundID RoundID, baseKeys []Key) Message {
	salt2 = H(salt)

	keyEcrA = ClientKeyGen(grp, salt, roundID, baseKeys)
	keyEcrB = ClientKeyGen(grp, salt2, roundID, baseKeys)

	EcrPayloadA, _ = elgamal_encrypt(keyEcrA, msg.PayloadA)
	EcrPayloadB, _ = elgamal_encrypt(keyEcrB, msg.PayloadB)

	primeLen = p.Len()
	encryptedMsg = NewMessage(primeLen)
	encryptedMsg.SetPayloadA(EcrPayloadA.LeftpadBytes(uint64(primeLen)))
	encryptedMsg.SetPayloadB(EcrPayloadB.LeftpadBytes(uint64(primeLen)))

	return encryptedMsg
}
```

The keys to encrypt each payload are deterministically generated
by iteratively hashing with Blake2b and then SHA256 each symmetric key along
with the salt, cMix Round ID and the string "cmixClientNodeKeyGenerationSalt".
The resulting 32 byte value is then feed into HKDF_SHA256, and expanded to
the correct number of bytes for the prime order cyclic group.

```
func ClientKeyGen(salt []byte, roundID RoundID, symmetricKeys []*Key) *Key {
	output = NewKey()
	tmpKey = NewKey()

	for _, symmetricKey = range symmetricKeys {
		h = SHA256_Hash(
		         Blake2b_Hash(
				     symmetricKey | salt | roundID | "cmixClientNodeKeyGenerationSalt"))
	    hashFunc = func() goHash.Hash { return sha256.New() }
        keyGen = hkdf.Expand(hashFunc, h, nil)
		pBytes = make([]byte, p.Len())
	    tmpKey, err = csprng.GenerateInGroup(pBytes, len(p.Len()), keyGen)
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}

		output = tmpKey * output % p
	}

	return Inverse(output)
}
```

You may recall from the [ElGamal encryption protocol](https://people.csail.mit.edu/alinush/6.857-spring-2015/papers/elgamal.pdf)
that the inverse of the encryption key is used to decrypt. And as
mentioned previously, cMix makes use of the partial homomorphic
properties of ElGamal to form the group computations. In particular,
all the mix nodes in a given cascade perform their computations on
the message to decrypt it.

We prevent the mix nodes from having to invert the key by having the
client encrypt with the inverted key. That way, when the mix nodes
deterministically compute their keys, they perform the exact same
steps as the client except that they ommit the final inversion
step. The generated key is the inverse of the key used to encrypt and
therefore can be used to decrypt.

Likewise the `GenerateInGroup` is designed specifically for generating
keys within a cyclic group for usage with ElGamal cryptosystems. You can
see the gory details in the code, here:

https://git.xx.network/xx_network/crypto/-/blob/release/csprng/source.go#L82-186

## Mix Node Slot

Here we have the protobuf definition of the `Slot` message type. It
actually has two discrete uses. The first is for precomputation
fields and for that it's exchanged between mix nodes. The other use is
realtime mixing where the client sends the `Slot` message to the Gateway
and it continues through the mix cascade.

```
// Represents a single encrypted message in a batch
message Slot {
    // Index in batch this slot belongs in
    uint32 Index = 1;

    // Precomputation fields
    bytes EncryptedPayloadAKeys = 2;
    bytes EncryptedPayloadBKeys = 3;
    bytes PartialPayloadACypherText = 4;
    bytes PartialPayloadBCypherText = 5;
    bytes PartialRoundPublicCypherKey = 6;

    // Realtime/client fields
    bytes SenderID = 7; // 256 bit Sender Id
    bytes PayloadA = 8; // Len(Prime) bit length payload A (contains part of encrypted payload)
    bytes PayloadB = 9; // Len(Prime) bit length payload B (contains part of encrypted payload, and associated data)
    bytes Salt = 10; // Salt to identify message key
    repeated bytes KMACs = 11; // Individual Key MAC for each node in network
}
```

## Inbound Message Queueing

Clients send their messages to any Gateway which in turn proxies the
message to the Gateway assigned to the chosen mix cascade.  The
cascade's assigned Gateway queues messages until either 1000 messages
are accumulated or no more time is left to collect messages.
The Gateway then sends the batch of 1000 messages to the first mix node.
If less than 1000 messages were accumulated then the Gateway sends dummy
messages in place of the missing messages.

## Real-time Mix Node Message Processing

This section describes the cMix mixing strategy. Many of the
mathematical details are described in the [published cMix paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/008.pdf)
and assume an understanding of cryptographic protocol composition
using ElGamal. However here we attempt a more approachable explanation
of the cMix design.

Keep in mind that a batch mix strategy at minimum has two basic goals each time
it mixes a batch of messages:

1. Bitwise message unlinkability: This means we use message
encryption such that the input is transformed so that the output
message is different. The two cannot be linked by their patterns of
bits.

2. The output message slots are shuffled in relation to the input
message slots.

An implied consequence of the fundamental design goals of mix networks
is end to end encryption from the sending client to the last mix node
in the mix cascade. This guarantees message authenticity and confidentiality
all the way to the last node. After that point the contents of the message
will not be protected by the mix network protocol.

Mix networks have an *anytrust* threat model which means that clients can
rely on the mix cascade to provide anonymity privacy properties as long
as any of the mix nodes in that mix cascade are honest and not compromised.
See our [threat model document](threat_model.md) for more discussion about
our mix network threat model.

Each cMix message is composed of two payloads, PayloadA and PayloadB.
The reason for this design is simple: In ElGamal, the message
size is limited to the size of the cyclic group space. It turns out
that our choice of 4096 bit cyclic group did not provide a big enough
payload capacity for a few of our intended use cases. One of those use
cases is the end to end ratchet encryption protocol described in our [end to end protocol](end_to_end.md)
design document because it exchanges large SIDH keys.

Below we work an example for a single message traversing a mix cascade
composed of three mix nodes. However this can in principle be scaled
to N mix nodes per cascade. And likewise we attempt to simplify the
explanation of the cMix real-time protocol phase by only considering a
single message whereas our mix node implementation operates on 1000
messages per mix batch. Below we write our pseudo code notation using
the `permute` function to denote using the [Fisher Yates shuffling alogrithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle).

### Real-time Phase 1: Preprocessing and Re-Encryption

Firstly, the cMix client makes use of the [xx network's wire protocol, gRPC/TLS/TCP/IP](wire.md),
and sends a `Slot` message to the Gateway:

```
M * K1 * K2 * K3, senderID, salt, KMAC1, KMAC2, KMAC3
```

The KMACs fields are used to ensure that the ciphertext was composed
of the expected symmetric keys. Each hop through the mix cascade
results in one of the K values being removed and an R value being
multiplied in.

If we describe all the transformations in this phase it would look like this for three hops:

```
// hop 1
[M * K1 * K2 * K3] * [k1^-1 * R1] = [M * K2 * K3 * R1], senderID, salt, KMAC2, KMAC3

// hop 2
[M * K2 * K3 * R1] * [k2^-1 * R2] = [M * K3 * R1 * R2], senderID, salt, KMAC3

// hop 3
[M * K3 * R1 * R2] * [k3^-1 * R3] = [M * R1 * R2 * R3]
```

At hop 1, the mix node receives this message:

```
[M * K1 * K2 * K3], senderID, salt, KMAC1, KMAC2, KMAC3
```

Hop 1 compares `HMAC(K1, K1) == KMAC1`, if not equal then the message
is discarded, else continue. Hop 1 removes the KMAC1 field from the
message. Hop 1 cryptographically transforms the payload portion of the
message by multiplying in `R1` and by removing the `K1` factor by
multiplying in it's inverse:

```
[M * K1 * K2 * K3] * [K1^-1 * R1] = [M * K2 * K3 * R1]
```

Therefore the message transmitted from Hop 1 to Hop 2 is:

```
[M * K2 * K3 * R1], senderID, salt, KMAC2, KMAC3
```

Once all mixes process the message in this way, all the K values are
removed from the message and the `R` values are multiplied in.
Additionally the SenderID, Salt, KMACs are stripped off the message
resulting in the following message ciphertext:

```
M * R1 * R2 * R3
```

### Real-time Phase 2: Mixing

Every mix node reorders all messages in the batch and multiplies in blinding factor S.
For example the output of the first mix node includes the `S1` factor:

```
permute{M * R1 * R2 * R3} * S1
```

And after traversing all the mix nodes in the cascade the message becomes:

```
permute{permute{permute{M * R1 * R2 * R3} * S1} * S2} * S3
```

### Real-time Phase 3: Reveal

This precomputed value is used to reveal the message, M:

```
(permute{permute{permute{M * R1 * R2 * R3} * S1} * S2} * S3) * ((permute{permute{permute{R1 * R2 * R3} * S1} * S2} * S3)^-1) = M
```

This last message reveal computation is performed by the last mix in the mix cascade.

**Notice:** The notation in the above mathematical expressions
indicate the use of the permutation function before multiplying the
terms together to make them easier to read. Our implimentation runs
the permute function last because it was easier to implement that
way. These are mathematically equivalent as long as they are done
consistently throughout all protocol phases.

## Cascade Mix Precomputation

The Precomputation phases of the protocol happens before the
real-time mixing. The results of the precomputation in a mix
cascade composed of three mix nodes is computed like this:

```
(permute{permute{permute{R1 * R2 * R3} * S1} * S2} * S3)^-1
```

In our above notation each of the `R1` and `S1` variables indicate a random
value chosen by the first mix node. Each `R` and `S` value in turn is selected
by each mix in the cascade. It is a group computation which is achieved by
using the homomorphic properties of modular multiplication.

### Setup Shared Public Key

A prerequisite for the precomputation protocol phases is the computation of
a shared secret among all the mix nodes in the given mix cascade. We
call this the `multiparty diffiehellman` and it's computed like so:

1. The first mix node generates a new key, `a` and raises `g` to the
   power of `a` and sends that to the next mix node:

```
g^a
```
2. The second mix node generates a new key, `b` and receives `g^a` and
   raises this to the power of `b` and sends that to the next mix node:

```
g^a^b
```
3. The last mix node generates a new key, `c` and receives `g^a^b` and
   raises this to the power of `c` and broadcasts this to all the other nodes:

```
g^a^b^c
```

The [cMix paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/008.pdf) mentions the
generation of this shared public key in the `Setup` section on page 7
at the bottom of the page. Our implementation computes the shared
secret here:

https://git.xx.network/elixxir/server/-/blob/0cf5347fc01920e7099cf0274d8b5bc8a4768a19/graphs/precomputation/share.go#L87


The last mix node sends the shared public key to the rest of mix nodes in the cascade.
Furthermore our code contains the assertion:

```
g^a^b^c == g^b^c^a == g^c^b^a == g^c^a^b == g^b^a^c == g^a^c^b
```

### Precomputation Phase 1: Multiplying in the encrypted R values

In this phase of the protocol each mix node in turn multiplies
in it's encrypted `R` value creating a new 2-tuple to send to the
next mix node in the cascade.


We initialize with a 2-tuple value of (1,1).
The computation performed at each mix node is simply:
Multiply the given 2-tuple with the resulting 2-tuple of the
ElGamal encryption of that node's `R` value. In pseudo code it looks
like this where the initial 2-tuple is passed into the function arguments:

```
func handle_phase1(encrypted_key, ciphertext []byte) ([]byte, []byte) {
	new_ciphertext, new_encrypted_key = elgamal_encrypt(k, R)
	return ciphertext * new_ciphertext, encrypted_key * new_encrypted_key
}
```

Here's what all the expanded calculations look like for each hop:

```
// Hop 1
previous_ciphertext = 1
previous_encrypted_key = 1
ciphertext, encrypted_key = elgamal_encrypt(Z, R1)
ciphertext                = R1 * g^x1
encrypted_key             = Z^x1
new_ciphertext = previous_ciphertext * ciphertext
new_ciphertext = 1 * ciphertext
new_ciphertext = 1 * R1 * g^x1
new_ciphertext = R1 * g^x1
new_encrypted_key = previous_encrypted_key * encrypted_key
new_encrypted_key = 1 * encrypted_key
new_encrypted_key = 1 * Z^x1
new_encrypted_key = Z^x1

// Hop 2
previous_ciphertext = new_ciphertext = R1 * g^x1
previous_encrypted_key = new_encrypted_key = Z^x1
ciphertext, encrypted_key = elgamal_encrypt(Z, R2)
ciphertext                = R2 * g^x2
encrypted_key             = Z^x2
new_ciphertext = previous_ciphertext * ciphertext
new_ciphertext = (R1 * g^x1) * ciphertext
new_ciphertext = (R1 * g^x1) * R2 * g^x2
new_ciphertext = R1 * R2 * g^x1 * g^x2
new_ciphertext = R1 * R2 * g^(x1 + x2)
new_encrypted_key = previous_encrypted_key * encrypted_key
new_encrypted_key = Z^x1 * encrypted_key
new_encrypted_key = Z^x1 * Z^x2
new_encrypted_key = Z^(x1 + x2)

// Hop 3
previous_ciphertext = new_ciphertext = (R1 * R2 * g^(x1 + x2)
previous_encrypted_key = new_encrypted_key = Z^(x1 + x2)
previous_ciphertext = R1 * R2 * g^(x1 + x2)
previous_encrypted_key = Z^(x1 + x2)
ciphertext, encrypted_key = elgamal_encrypt(Z, R3)
ciphertext                = R3 * g^x3
encrypted_key             = Z^x3
new_ciphertext = previous_ciphertext * ciphertext
new_ciphertext = R1 * R2 * g^(x1 + x2) * ciphertext
new_ciphertext = R1 * R2 * g^(x1 + x2) * R3 * g^x3
new_ciphertext = R1 * R2 * R3 * g^(x1 + x2) * g^x3
new_ciphertext = R1 * R2 * R3 * g^(x1 + x2 + x3)
new_encrypted_key = previous_encrypted_key * encrypted_key
new_encrypted_key = Z^(x1 + x2) * encrypted_key
new_encrypted_key = Z^(x1 + x2) * Z^x3
new_encrypted_key = Z^(x1 + x2 + x3)
```

The above protocol phase concludes with a ciphertext composed of:

```
previous_encrypted_payload = R1 * R2 * R3 * g^(x1 + x2 + x3)
```

And an encrypted key composed of:

```
previous_encrypted_key = Z^(x1 + x2 + x3)
```

The last mix node sends the computed 2-tuple to the first mix node in the cascade so that
it can be used to initialize the next protocol phase.

### Precomputation Phase 2: Multiplying the S values and calculating the permutation

The first mix node in the cascade receives the 2-tuple computed in the previous
protocol phase, that is, a ciphertext of `R1 * R2 * R3 * g^(x1 + x2 + x3)`
and an encrypted key of `Z^(x1 + x2 + x3)`.

The following computation is performed:

```
encrypted_payload, encrypted_key = elgamal_encrypt(Z, S1)
encrypted_payload = permute{previous_encrypted_payload} * encrypted_payload
encrypted_key = previous_encrypted_key * encrypted_key
```

Each node in turn processes the received message with calculating the
permutation and then multiplying in the `S` value:

```
// Hop 1
previous_encrypted_payload = R1 * R2 * R3 * g^(x1 + x2 + x3)
previous_encrypted_key = Z^(x1 + x2 + x3)
encrypted_payload, encrypted_key = elgamal_encrypt(Z, S1)  
encrypted_payload = permute{previous_encrypted_payload} * encrypted_payload
encrypted_payload = permute{R1 * R2 * R3 * g^(x1 + x2 + x3)} * encrypted_payload
encrypted_payload = permute{R1 * R2 * R3 * g^(x1 + x2 + x3)} * (S1 * g^y1)
encrypted_payload = permute{R1 * R2 * R3} * S1 * g^(permute{x1 + x2 + x3} + y1)
encrypted_key = previous_encrypted_key * encrypted_key
encrypted_key = Z^(x1 + x2 + x3) * encrypted_key
encrypted_key = Z^(x1 + x2 + x3) * Z^y1
encrypted_key = Z^(permute{x1 + x2 + x3} + y1)

// Hop 2
previous_encrypted_payload = permute{R1 * R2 * R3 * g^(x1 + x2 + x3)} * (S1 * g^y1)
previous_encrypted_key = Z^(permute{x1 + x2 + x3} + y1)
encrypted_payload, encrypted_key = elgamal_encrypt(Z, S2)
encrypted_payload = permute{previous_encrypted_payload} * encrypted_payload
encrypted_payload = permute{permute{R1 * R2 * R3 * g^(x1 + x2 + x3)} * (S1 * g^y1)} * encrypted_payload
encrypted_payload = permute{permute{R1 * R2 * R3 * g^(x1 + x2 + x3)} * (S1 * g^y1)} * (S2 * g^y2)
encrypted_payload = permute{permute{R1 * R2 * R3} * S1} * S2 * g^(permute{permute{x1 + x2 + x3} + y1} + y2)
encrypted_key = previous_encrypted_key * encrypted_key
encrypted_key = Z^(permute{x1 + x2 + x3} + y1) * encrypted_key
encrypted_key = Z^(permute{x1 + x2 + x3} + y1) * permute{Z^y2}
encrypted_key = Z^(permute{permute{x1 + x2 + x3} + y1} + y2)

// Hop 3
previous_encrypted_payload = permute{permute{R1 * R2 * R3 * g^(x1 + x2 + x3)} * (S1 * g^y1)} * (S2 * g^y2)
previous_encrypted_key = Z^(permute{permute{x1 + x2 + x3} + y1} + y2)
encrypted_payload, encrypted_key = elgamal_encrypt(Z, S3)
encrypted_payload = permute{previous_encrypted_payload} * encrypted_payload
encrypted_payload = permute{permute{permute{R1 * R2 * R3 * g^(x1 + x2 + x3)} * (S1 * g^y1)} * (S2 * g^y2)} * encrypted_payload
encrypted_payload = permute{permute{permute{R1 * R2 * R3 * g^(x1 + x2 + x3)} * (S1 * g^y1)} * (S2 * g^y2)} * (S3 * g^y3)
encrypted_payload = permute{permute{permute{R1 * R2 * R3} * S1} * S2} * S3 * g^(permute{permute{permute{x1 + x2 + x3} + y1} + y2} + y3)
encrypted_key = previous_encrypted_key * encrypted_key
encrypted_key = Z^(x1 + x2 + x3) * Z^(y1 + y2) * encrypted_key
encrypted_key = Z^(x1 + x2 + x3) * Z^(y1 + y2) * Z^y3
encrypted_key = Z^(x1 + x2 + x3) * Z^(y1 + y2 + y3)
encrypted_key = Z^(permute{permute{permute{x1 + x2 + x3} + y1} + y2} + y3)
```

### Precomputation Phase 3: Reveal

The reveal phase results in the following for
our mix cascade composed of three mix nodes:

```
(permute{permute{permute{R1 * R2 * R3} * S1} * S2} * S3)^-1
```

We operate on the encrypted key and the ciphertext computed from the previous protocol phase:

```
encrypted_key = Z^(permute{permute{permute{x1 + x2 + x3} + y1} + y2} + y3)
encrypted_payload = permute{permute{permute{R1 * R2 * R3} * S1} * S2} * S3 * g^(permute{permute{permute{x1 + x2 + x3} + y1} + y2} + y3)
```

Recall the definition of `Z`:
```
Z = g^(z1 * z2 * z3)
```

This is done one mix node key at a time as the message ciphertext traverses the mix cascade:

```
// Hop 1
previous_encrypted_key = Z^(permute{permute{permute{x1 + x2 + x3} + y1} + y2} + y3)
encrypted_key = strip(z1, previous_encrypted_key)
encrypted_key = z1^-1 * previous_encrypted_key
encrypted_key = z1^-1 * Z^(permute{permute{permute{x1 + x2 + x3} + y1} + y2} + y3)
encrypted_key = z1^-1 * g^(z1 * z2 * z3)^(permute{permute{permute{x1 + x2 + x3} + y1} + y2} + y3)
encrypted_key = g^(z2 * z3)^(permute{permute{permute{x1 + x2 + x3} + y1} + y2} + y3)

// Hop 2
previous_encrypted_key = encrypted_key
previous_encrypted_key = g^(z2 * z3)^(permute{permute{permute{x1 + x2 + x3} + y1} + y2} + y3)
encrypted_key = strip(z2, previous_encrypted_key)
encrypted_key = strip(z2, g^(z2 * z3)^(permute{permute{permute{x1 + x2 + x3} + y1} + y2} + y3))
encrypted_key = z2^-1 * g^(z2 * z3)^(permute{permute{permute{x1 + x2 + x3} + y1} + y2} + y3)
encrypted_key = g^z3^(permute{permute{permute{x1 + x2 + x3} + y1} + y2} + y3)

// Hop 3
previous_encrypted_key = encrypted_key
previous_encrypted_key = g^z3^(permute{permute{permute{x1 + x2 + x3} + y1} + y2} + y3)
encrypted_key = strip(z3, previous_encrypted_key)
encrypted_key = strip(z3, g^z3^(permute{permute{permute{x1 + x2 + x3} + y1} + y2} + y3))
encrypted_key = z3^-1 * g^z3^(permute{permute{permute{x1 + x2 + x3} + y1} + y2} + y3))
encrypted_key = g^(permute{permute{permute{x1 + x2 + x3} + y1} + y2} + y3))
```

The last mix node determines the result:

```
encrypted_payload = permute{permute{permute{R1 * R2 * R3} * S1} * S2} * S3 * g^(permute{permute{permute{x1 + x2 + x3} + y1} + y2} + y3)
encrypted_key = g^(permute{permute{permute{x1 + x2 + x3} + y1} + y2} + y3))
payload = encrypted_key^-1 * encrypted_payload
payload = encrypted_key^-1 * permute{permute{permute{R1 * R2 * R3} * S1} * S2} * S3 * g^(permute{permute{permute{x1 + x2 + x3} + y1} + y2} + y3)
payload = (g^(permute{permute{permute{x1 + x2 + x3} + y1} + y2} + y3)))^-1
  * permute{permute{permute{R1 * R2 * R3} * S1} * S2} * S3
  * g^(permute{permute{permute{x1 + x2 + x3} + y1} + y2} + y3)
payload = permute{permute{permute{R1 * R2 * R3} * S1} * S2} * S3
```

The decrypted value is:

```
(permute{permute{permute{R1 * R2 * R3} * S1} * S2} * S3)
```

We invert the value to achieve the final precomputation value:

```
(permute{permute{permute{R1 * R2 * R3} * S1} * S2} * S3)^-1
```

## Security Considerations

## Anonymity Considerations

* The design of the Auth protocol avoids leaking identity keys on the
  communications channel in plaintext.

* The design of the message storage and retrieval deliberately avoids
  leaking identities to non-recipients. Using deterministic message
  fingerprints to tag messages and avoid trial decryption.
